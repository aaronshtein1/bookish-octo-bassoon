# Copy this file to .env and fill in your credentials
# NEVER commit the .env file to version control!

# HHA Exchange Credentials
HHAE_USERNAME=aaronshtein
HHAE_PASSWORD=AHS2025!home
HHAE_EMAIL=your-email@outlook.com

# Optional: Logging level (debug, info, warn, error)
LOG_LEVEL=info

# Automatic MFA via Email (Optional - for fully automated headless operation)
#
# OPTION 1: IMAP Method (Simpler - Recommended)
# For Outlook.com: Generate an app password at https://account.microsoft.com/security
# For Gmail: Use an App Password (https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-email-app-password
# Or use this variable name:
# EMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your-email-app-password
#
# OPTION 2: Microsoft Graph API (More secure, requires Azure AD setup)
# See SETUP-MFA-AUTOMATION.md for detailed instructions
# AZURE_CLIENT_ID=your-azure-app-client-id
# AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-azure-app-client-secret
# AZURE_TENANT_ID=your-azure-tenant-id

# Notes:
# - These credentials are for an authorized account with permission to access reports
# - The password will be redacted from logs automatically
# - Use a dedicated service account when possible
# - For MFA-enabled accounts without email automation, run with --headful flag to manually complete MFA
# - With email automation configured, MFA will be handled automatically even in headless mode
